	of a large number of different proteins. Understanding how these protein

	to monitor simultaneously multiple components at high spatiotemporal

However, non-uniform illumination in optical micrographs is a common, yet avoidable artefact, often caused by the setup of the microscope, or by inherent properties caused by the nature of the sample. In this paper, we demonstrate simple matrix-based methods using the common computing environments MATLAB and Python to correct nonuniform illumination, using either a background image or extracting illumination information directly from the sample image, together with subsequent image processing. We compare the processes, algorithms, and results obtained from both MATLAB (commercially available) and Python (freeware). Additionally, we validate our method by evaluating commonly used alternative approaches, demonstrating that the best nonuniform illumination correction can be achieved when a separate background image is available.},

Some laboratory microscope systems have been developed but they are too expensive and complex to be used on production lines. The atomic force microscope, with its image analysis software, has proved to be ideal for characterizing scratches and digs which, it is hoped, will assist the development of simpler optical microscope systems. The atomic force microscope images are repeated by the scanning electron microscope micrographs and both have their particular merits. The Form Talysurf was found to have insufficient resolution for the smallest unacceptable scratches and digs but could measure the waviness and form of large components.},

Metaphase chromosomes from lymphocytes which had incorporated 5-bromodeoxyuridine for two replication cycles were treated with the dye 33258 Hoechst and photodegraded so that the sister chromatids exhibited differential Giemsa staining. A computer-controlled television-microscope system was used to acquire digitized metaphase spread images by direct scanning of microscope slides. Individual objects in the images were identified by a thresholding procedure. The probability that each object was a single, separate chromosome was estimated from size and shape measurements. An analysis of the spatial relationships of the dark-chromatid regions of each object yielded a set of possible exchange locations and estimated probabilities that such locations corresponded to sister chromatid exchanges. A normalized estimate of the sister chromatid exchange frequency was obtained by summing the joint probabilities that a location contained an exchange within a single, separate chromosome over the set of chromosomes from one or more cells and dividing by the expected value of the total chromosome area analyzed. Comparison with manual scoring of exchanges showed satisfactory agreement up to levels of approximately 30 sister chromatid exchanges/cell, or slightly more than twice control levels. The processing time for this automated sister chromatid exchange detection system was comparable to that of manual scoring. },

abstract = "Spatial resolution is one of the most critical measurement parameters in infrared microspectroscopy. Due to the distinct levels of morphologic heterogeneity in cells and tissues the spatial resolution in a given IR imaging setup strongly affects the character of the infrared spectral patterns obtained from the biomedical samples. This is particularly important when spectral data bases of reference microspectra from defined tissue structures are collected. In this paper we have also pointed out that the concept of spatial resolution in IR imaging is inseparable from the contrast. Based on infrared microspectroscopic transmittance data acquired from an USAF 1951 resolution target we have demonstrated how the spatial resolution can be determined experimentally and some numbers for the spatial resolution of popular IR imaging systems are provided. Finally, we have presented a new computational procedure which is suitable to improve the spatial resolution in IR imaging. A theoretical model of 3D-Fourier self-deconvolution (FSD) is given and advantages or pitfalls of this method are discussed. Based on synchrotron IR microspectroscopic data we have furthermore demonstrated that the technique of 3D-FSD can be successfully applied to increase the spatial resolution in a real IR imaging setup."

Such compounds have already been studied by Raman spectroscopy, but there are some disagreements in the reported data. Here, Raman microscopy was employed to investigate the laser power dependence of the spectra of these oxides and oxyhydroxides. Low laser power was used for the reference spectra in order to minimize the risks of spectral changes due to sample degradation. The results obtained show that increasing laser power causes the characteristic bands of hematite to show up in the spectra of most of the compounds studied whereas the hematite spectrum undergoes band broadening and band shifts. © 1997 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},
