	abstract = {Abstract Cellular functions emerge from the collective action 
	of a large number of different proteins. Understanding how these protein 
	networks operate requires monitoring their components in intact cells. Due 
	to intercellular and intracellular molecular variability, it is important 
	to monitor simultaneously multiple components at high spatiotemporal 
	resolution. However, inherent trade-offs narrow the boundaries of 
	achievable multiplexed imaging. Pushing these boundaries is essential for a 
	better understanding of cellular processes. Here the motivations, 
	challenges and approaches for multiplexed imaging of intracellular protein 
	networks are discussed. © 2016 International Society for Advancement of
