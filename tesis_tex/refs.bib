	abstract = {Abstract Cellular functions emerge from the collective action 
	of a large number of different proteins. Understanding how these protein 
	networks operate requires monitoring their components in intact cells. Due 
	to intercellular and intracellular molecular variability, it is important 
	to monitor simultaneously multiple components at high spatiotemporal 
	resolution. However, inherent trade-offs narrow the boundaries of 
	achievable multiplexed imaging. Pushing these boundaries is essential for a 
	better understanding of cellular processes. Here the motivations, 
	challenges and approaches for multiplexed imaging of intracellular protein 
	networks are discussed. © 2016 International Society for Advancement of

	abstract = {With a perfectly uniform illumination, the amount and concentration of fluorophores in any (biological) sample can be read directly from fluorescence micrographs. However, non-uniform illumination in optical micrographs is a common, yet avoidable artefact, often caused by the setup of the microscope, or by inherent properties caused by the nature of the sample. In this paper, we demonstrate simple matrix-based methods using the common computing environments MATLAB and Python to correct nonuniform illumination, using either a background image or extracting illumination information directly from the sample image, together with subsequent image processing. We compare the processes, algorithms, and results obtained from both MATLAB (commercially available) and Python (freeware). Additionally, we validate our method by evaluating commonly used alternative approaches, demonstrating that the best nonuniform illumination correction can be achieved when a separate background image is available.}

Some laboratory microscope systems have been developed but they are too expensive and complex to be used on production lines. The atomic force microscope, with its image analysis software, has proved to be ideal for characterizing scratches and digs which, it is hoped, will assist the development of simpler optical microscope systems. The atomic force microscope images are repeated by the scanning electron microscope micrographs and both have their particular merits. The Form Talysurf was found to have insufficient resolution for the smallest unacceptable scratches and digs but could measure the waviness and form of large components.}
